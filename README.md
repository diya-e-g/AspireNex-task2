# BrainTease
I have built a quiz maker website named BrainTease using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that enables users to create and take quizzes. Users can input questions, multiple-choice
answers, and correct answers to build a quiz. Other users can then take the quiz and receive immediate
feedback on their scores.
